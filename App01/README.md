Description:
A simple quote generator app that will let you choose quote's category from a drop down menu.
"I'm feeling lucky" will grab a random quote.
Created with Luke Peavey Quotable API.
Quote's container (Modal) is mobile friendly where user could scroll down an overly long quotes and could click close button to close the modal.

Background & Approach:

I am always fascinated with minimalistic approach of things.
Simple and clean design with clear functionality.

I've designed this app with us in mind, I am hoping this app can be useful for anyone that need a little bit of push to get motivated during tough times.

The v1 of the app had button for each category of the quotes but I then I think that will be similar with one of the homework so I did research on how to build a drop down menu and using the text in the drop down menu as a way to call the API data.
